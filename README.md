### 🧠 About Me

I am actively seeking an **apprenticeship opportunity in Software Development/Engineering**, with a strong interest in mathematics, healthcare, AI, and biochemical technology. <br>
I’m also exploring **DataAnnotation** and freelance work - Freelancing is an exciting challenge I’m eager to explore further with hands-on experience.

### 💻 My Coding Journey

My programming journey began with a Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp (**HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and the **MERN** stack), but it was **Python** that truly reignited my passion for coding and computer science. <br>
My goal has been to write functional code grounded in best practices - clean, modular, and easy to maintain - while diving deeper into CS topics like **Floating-Point Precision Errors**, **Time Complexity**, **Recursion**, and **Memoization**. <br>
I regularly build personal projects that go beyond course content, using structured learning as a springboard for broader exploration.

### 🔬 My Background

Before transitioning into programming, I worked as a **Dispensary Assistant** in community pharmacy, and also gained experience in **animal care** and **healthcare support**. <br>

These roles sharpened a range of transferrable skills: 
- **Attention to detail** and **accuracy** - particularly through prescription dispensing and reviews.
- **Problem-solving** - by assisting patients with over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription queries through consultation, recommending suitable treatments, or signposting appropriately.
- **Passion for learning** - One of the things that initially attracted me to Pharmacy was lifelong learning; something I've wholly embraced with programming.
- **Collaboration** - I enjoy building strong working relationships and fostering a supportive team dynamic. I actively seek to understand my colleagues’ strengths and areas for growth, and aim to complement their skills wherever I can. <br>

These strengths have laid a solid foundation for my programming journey, and I’m confident they’ll continue to support my growth as a developer.

After several years in community pharmacy, I made the decision to pursue software development. <br>
The pharmacy sector in the UK has been under increasing pressure following *major* NHS budget cuts - leading to high staff turnover, limited progression opportunities, and, in many places, a work environment that often lacked support and stability. <br>
While I’m grateful for the skills and resilience I developed there - and for the opportunity to work alongside some amazing people - I ultimately wanted to move into a field with greater creative freedom and growth potential. <br>

### 🚀 Aspirations

I'm especially interested in building software that supports **scientific research**, **healthcare**, **zoology** and **education** - areas where I believe programming can directly contribute to solving real-world problems.

On a personal level, I’m deeply driven by curiosity and the challenge of solving complex problems - whether it’s optimizing an algorithm, learning a new library (like `matplotlib`), or building something from scratch. I've learnt to embrace the struggle of programming, as that's often where the deepest learning happens.

One of the things that excites me most about programming is how much there is to learn. While it can feel daunting to stand at the base of such a vast summit, it’s also incredibly motivating. <br> 
Programming is a field with an extremely high skill ceiling — no matter how much you know, there’s always a new concept, tool, language, or framework to explore. <br>
That constant opportunity for growth is a key driver of my passion for coding.
