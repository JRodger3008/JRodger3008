### 🧠 About Me

I am actively seeking an **apprenticeship opportunity in software development/engineering**, with a strong interest in mathematics, healthcare, AI, and biochemical technology. 
I’m also exploring **DataAnnotation** and freelance work - freelancing feels like an exciting challenge I look forward to tackling with more hands-on experience.

### 💻 My Coding Journey

My programming journey began with a Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp (**HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and the **MERN** stack), but it was **Python** that truly reignited my passion for coding and computer science. 
I've since focused on writing clean, well-documented code and exploring deeper computer science concepts - such as **Floating-Point Precision Errors**, **Time Complexity**, **Recursion**, and **Memoization**. 
I regularly build personal projects that go beyond course content, using structured learning as a springboard for broader exploration.

### 🔬 My Background

Before transitioning into programming, I worked as a **Dispensary Assistant in Community Pharmacy**, and also gained experience in **animal care** and **healthcare support**. 
These roles sharpened a range of transferrable skills: 
- **Attention to detail** and **accuracy** - particularly through prescription dispensing and reviews.
- **Problem-solving** - by assisting patients with over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription queries through consultation, recommending suitable treatments, or signposting appropriately.
- **Passion for learning** - One of the things that initially attracted me to Pharmacy was lifelong learning; something I've wholly embraced with programming.
- **Collaboration** - I enjoy building strong working relationships and fostering a supportive team dynamic. I actively seek to understand my colleagues’ strengths and areas for growth, and aim to complement their skills wherever I can.
These strengths have laid a solid foundation for my programming journey, and I’m confident they’ll continue to support my growth as a developer.

### 🚀 Aspirations

I'm especially interested in building software that supports **scientific research**, **healthcare**, **zoology** and **education** - areas where I believe programming can directly contribute to solving real-world problems.

On a personal level, I’m driven by curiosity and the challenge of solving complex problems - whether it’s optimizing an algorithm, learning a new library (like `matplotlib`), or building something from scratch.
