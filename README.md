## _Aspiring Software Developer | Special interests in Biochemistry, Pharmacy, and Zoology_

I am actively seeking an apprenticeship opportunity in software development/engineering, with a strong interest in mathematics, healthcare, AI, and biochemical technology. Iâ€™m also exploring DataAnnotation and freelance work - freelancing feels like an exciting challenge I look forward to tackling with more hands-on experience.

My programming journey began with a Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp (**HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and the **MERN** stack), but it was **Python** that truly reignited my passion for coding and computer science. I've since focused on writing clean, well-documented code and exploring deeper computer science concepts - such as **Floating-Point Precision Errors**, **Time Complexity**, **Memoization** and **Recursion**. 
I regularly build personal projects that go beyond course content, using structured learning as a springboard for broader exploration.

Before transitioning into programming, I worked as a Dispensary Assistant in Pharmacy, and also gained experience in animal care and healthcare support. These roles sharpened my attention to detail and accuracy - particularly through prescription dispensing and reviews. They also strengthened my problem-solving skills by assisting patients with over-the-counter (OTC) queries through consultation, recommending suitable treatments, or signposting appropriately. 
Beyond the technical aspects, these experiences fostered a strong ethic of collaboration and lifelong learning â€” qualities that continue to shape my growth as a developer.

Iâ€™m driven by the goal of creating accessible, user-friendly software that bridges the gap between complex technology and real-world needs - empowering users through intuitive and informative tools. I also aspire to contribute to projects in biological sciences and mathematics that challenge the limits of what software can achieve in research settings (though I know this is a big, idealistic dream - one Iâ€™m excited to chase).

Iâ€™m proud to have earned a 99% average upon completing my Web Development Bootcamp, and to have earned the Python Essentials 1 certification (Cisco/Netacad): [Python Essentials 1 Badge](https://www.credly.com/badges/bf850d97-aec6-41bf-b7aa-35aafcc19e19). I've also just recently enrolled on to the Python Essentials 2 course.
