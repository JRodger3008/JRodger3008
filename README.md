## _Full-Stack Web Development Student (CoGrammar/Hyperion Dev)_

Realising the breakneck pace of technological development, and having a deep and inebriating curiosity for technology, AI, and web development, I have decided to learn and hone coding skills in order to begin a career in this space.

I am currently enrolled on a 16 week Full-Stack Web Developement course (CoGrammar/ Hyperion Dev - DfE), and intend to work towards a full time apprenticeship.

An ideal of mine is to marry my knowledge of healthcare (Pharmacy) with technology and coding.
Not only would my many years of study and professional experience in Pharmacy be invaluble, but learning the versatile skills of coding in multiple languages (HTML, CSS, Python, JavaScript etc.) will not only be enriching for myself, but also enhance my employability. 

Within my GitHub account, you will see tasks completed for my course and tasks I've set myself. My course focuses on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
<br>
The tasks I've set myself will be programmes I've developed in order to enrich my knowledge of other coding languages not focused on in my Web Development course (e.g Python).
